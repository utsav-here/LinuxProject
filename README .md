# Open Source Audit Project

## Student Details
- Name: Utsav Kaushal (24BCY10321)
- Course: Open Source Software
- Project Title: Open Source Audit

## Chosen Software
Git (Distributed Version Control System)

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing Git as an open-source software. It includes a detailed study of its origin, license, ecosystem, and comparison with proprietary systems. The project also involves practical implementation using Linux shell scripting to demonstrate understanding of open-source tools and system operations.

The objective of this project is to understand both theoretical and practical aspects of open-source software and its importance in modern computing.

## Scripts Overview

### Script 1: System Identity Report
This script displays system information such as kernel version, username, system uptime, date, and Linux distribution.

### Script 2: FOSS Package Inspector
This script checks whether Git is installed on the system and displays details like version and description.

### Script 3: Disk and Permission Auditor
This script analyzes system directories and displays disk usage and permissions.

### Script 4: Log File Analyzer
This script counts occurrences of a keyword in a log file and displays matching lines.

### Script 5: Open Source Manifesto Generator
This script generates a personalized manifesto based on user input.

## How to Run the Scripts

### Step 1: Make Scripts Executable
```bash
chmod +x script1.sh
chmod +x script2.sh
chmod +x script3.sh
chmod +x script4.sh
chmod +x script5.sh

Step 2: Run Scripts
./script1.sh
./script2.sh
./script3.sh
./script4.sh /var/log/syslog error
./script5.sh

Requirements:
Ubuntu (WSL) or Linux Environment
Bash Shell
Git installed

Output:
Scripts display output directly in the terminal
Script 5 generates a text file containing the manifesto

Learning Outcomes:
Understanding of open-source software concepts
Hands-on experience with Linux commands
Knowledge of shell scripting (loops, conditions, variables)
Understanding of Git and its ecosystem

Conclusion:
This project provided a comprehensive understanding of open-source software through both theoretical analysis and practical implementation. Git was studied in detail, and shell scripting skills were developed. The project highlights the importance of open-source tools in modern software development.
